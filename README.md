# üßë‚Äçüî¨ **Scientific Inventors Analysis - Interactive Dashboard**

## üìù **Project Description**
This project aims to create an **interactive dashboard** using **Tableau** to analyze **scientific inventors**, their **inventions**, and the **funding** they have received throughout history, from 1500 to 2024. Through a detailed data analysis, we have identified key patterns related to the **geographical distribution**, **recognition**, and **financial support** these inventors have received during their careers.

## üîÑ **Workflow**
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: A dataset of scientific inventors was collected from various reliable sources. Data cleaning and preprocessing tasks were carried out to ensure the data was ready for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: An exploratory analysis of the data was conducted to identify key patterns, trends, and correlations such as the **geographical distribution** of inventors, the **funding received**, and **social recognition**.

3. **Dashboard Creation**: With the processed data, a set of **interactive dashboards** was created in **Tableau** to visualize various metrics and provide a dynamic and accessible user experience.

4. **Validation and Refinement**: A review process was carried out to ensure that the visualizations were clear, accurate, and easy to understand, adapting the dashboards to effectively tell the story.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies Used**
- **Tableau**: Main tool used for creating the interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Python** (optional): For data cleaning and preprocessing before importing the data into Tableau.
- **Web Scraping Libraries** (if necessary): To collect additional data from the web.

## üéØ **Project Objectives**
- **Visualize the history** of scientific inventors, their inventions, and the financial support they received.
- **Identify geographical, gender, and occupation patterns** in the field of scientific innovation.
- **Explore trends in funding** and recognition of inventors over time.
- **Generate an interactive visualization** that allows users to explore the data dynamically and educationally.

## üåç **Impact and Results**
- **Accessible visualization**: The creation of an interactive dashboard allows users to easily explore and understand historical patterns of scientific innovation.
- **Identification of key trends**: Important trends were discovered, such as the strong representation of inventors from **North America** and **Europe**, as well as the dominance of **computing** in terms of funding.
- **Educational focus**: The project provides valuable insights into the history of innovation and inventors, contributing to collective knowledge in the fields of science and technology.

## üí° **Inspiration and Values**
This project was born from an interest in exploring the history of inventors and their contributions to science and technology. Inspired by the need to **visualize** historical data in an accessible way, we sought to build a tool that not only analyzes information but also **educates** and inspires future generations.

The values of **inclusion**, **equity**, and **access to knowledge** were fundamental in the creation of this project. We aim to show how financial support, education, and recognition play a key role in the careers of innovators and how these dynamics have evolved over time.

## üìä **Conclusions**
- **Geographical patterns**: North America and Europe continue to dominate in terms of scientific inventor representation, raising questions about access to education and resources for innovation.
- **Recognition and funding**: A significant percentage of inventors have been recognized in their lifetime, highlighting the importance of social support in their careers. Additionally, **the United States** has been a major funder, supporting both domestic and international inventors.
- **Innovation trends**: The most funded fields have been those related to **technology** and **computing**, reflecting the growing importance of these sectors in modern life.
- **Future opportunities**: If more countries and organizations invested in the funding and support of inventors from diverse regions, especially in disadvantaged environments, more global innovation opportunities could arise.
